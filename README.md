I am using this repo to play around with the semantic kernel. Feel free to clone this and use it for the same. Will keep adding examples here as I work on them.

### Steps:
1. Install python packages `semantic-kernel`, `azureopenai`, `dotenv`
2. For .env config, create a `.env` file in the root repo and copy the content of the `.env.example`.  Add the endpoints and key details from your Azure Open AI instance.
